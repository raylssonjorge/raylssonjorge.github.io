I am a polymath student(undergraduate). I am currently studying physics at the University of Minas Gerais. My interests of study is in a wide range of subjects that includes Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry and Programming. When I am not doing the above I am probably reading books, playing chess or learning about arts and humanities (history and art in general).

I am also interested in computers, free software and Open Source (two different things) in general.(How can one have true freedom using your own machine? ).

I will give a resume from my main interests:

1. Physics: Study of Dynamical Systems, Condensed matter, Classical Mechanics, Astrophysics.
2. Mathematics: Analysis, Advanced Calculus, Applied Mathematics, Number theory.
3. Chemistry: Study and simulation of the interaction of molecules (molecular dynamics) in a microscopic level using parallel computing.
4. Programming: Everything involving data visualization, manipulation of data and solving problems with the three subjects mentioned above. In the free time Machine Learning and Deep Learning are my occupation.
