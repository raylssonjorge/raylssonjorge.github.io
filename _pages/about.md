I am a polymath student(undergraduate). I am currently studying physics at the University of Minas Gerais. My interests of study is in a wide range of subjects that includes Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry and Programming. When I am not doing the above I am probably reading books, playing chess or learning about arts and humanities (history and art in general).
